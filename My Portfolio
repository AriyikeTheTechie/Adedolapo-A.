# Adedolapo-A.
I am a solution-driven Software Quality Assurance Analyst adept at contributing to a highly collaborative agile work environment, bringing to the table hands-on experience in the testing of software systems, knowledge of standard industry QA methodologies, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

My forte is in API testing and Web automation.

I can use various QA tools and project managements tools.

I'm more confident using Cypress and Appium. And for the management tools, I am more conversant with Jira, Slack, Azure, Google Suites, and Trello.
